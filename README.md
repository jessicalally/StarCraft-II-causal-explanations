# StarCraft II Causal Explanations 
This framework generates causal explanations for StarCraft II agents using structural causal models.
  - StarCraft II agents are trained using reinforcement learning Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm. 
  - Custom maps can be added, with different state features and actions (current agent uses a custom version of the Simple64 map with 9 features and 4 actions).
  - Structural equations can be trained using 3 different regressors (linear, trees and neural).

### Installation

-requires [pysc2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) 3.0+ to run. Please follow the installation instructions at pysc2 repo to install StarCraft II game and maps. Code was tested in a Linux environment. In a Windows system, framework should still work, but pysc2 won't be able to run headless.

-requires Tensorflow 1.14 (only tested with this version).

-requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

-requires [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) 1.11 (only works with 1.11 version)

-after installing Starcraft II and the maps, copy (and replace) the custom Simple64 map given in this repo to the StarCraft II installation directory<StarcraftII directory>/StarCraftII/Maps/Melee/

### Training and generating explanations
-To train with linear regressors for the Structural Causal Model (SCM)
```sh
$ python main.py test1 --map Simple64 --res 64 --envs 1 --max_windows 1 --nhwc --ow --data_size 2000 --scm_mode train --scm_regressor lr
```
Please see config_simulations.py for other configurations. Before training remove pre-trained SCM's in scm_model directory
-To generate explanations

```sh
$ python main.py test1 --map Simple64 --res 64 --envs 1 --max_windows 1 --nhwc --ow --data_size 16 --scm_mode infer --scm_regressor lr
```
